WGW2015-Client
==============

Client-side JS library for WhosGonnaWin campaign

## Building the project

**NOTE**: If you're just looking to use the js lib and not make any changes, you can skip this section.

    npm install -g gulp
    npm install -g browserify
    gulp

Gulp will now be looking for any changes you make to src/sosowgw.js and outputting the built result to the dist folder.
