Everything including registration/login stubbed out on ios end so vagrant is currently not needed to run the app.

No need to register. Upon login, test user is created so you can enter any user/pw for login as long as it's not
an empty string. Because a test user is created each time you login, any updates you make will be reset upon
logging out and back in.
