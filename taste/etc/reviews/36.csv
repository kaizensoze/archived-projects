Alta,8,8,7,8,,,"We came here for a friend's birthday and ordered the ""whole shabang"" -- literally it's the whole menu.  You get a taste of everything -- it's a fun spot for a date night or a big group gathering.  Service was friendly."
Blue Hill at Stone Barns,10,9,10,10,,,"This is a great place for special occasions.  I took my husband here for his birthday and they did a phenomenal job.  The service was spot on, the atmostphere was very shabby chic (think J.Crew on a farm) and the food was so fresh.  We got a sample of vegetables from the farm...  even a piece of romaine lettuce was delicious!  The food is SO fresh and inventive.  LOVED it."
Blue Ribbon Bakery,9,9,10,9,,,"I get something different every time I come here.  I love this place…  everything about it.  Service is always good, drinks are good and I love the atmosphere.  We had a small engagement party here.  But it's also great for a girls night out, date night or a casual lunch."
BONDST,6,6,8,4,,,"Quite honestly, I don't remember exactly what I ate when we came here, I just remember being underwhelmed by the food and disappointed with the slow, unattentive service.  We didn't come back."
Bubby's Brooklyn,9,9,9,9,,,This is a really fun place to come to for breakfast/brunch.  Very kid friendly.  Lots of natural light and a very warm and welcoming place -- both locations are great (Tribeca and Brooklyn)
Bubby's Tribeca,9,9,9,9,,,This is a really fun place to come to for breakfast/brunch.  Very kid friendly.  Lots of natural light and a very warm and welcoming place -- both locations are great (Tribeca and Brooklyn)
Colicchio and Sons,8,7,8,8,,,I went here once with some girlfriends.  Love the atmosphere.  The food was pretty good -- I got a fish dish that was pretty good.
Corner Bistro,8,9,8,8,bistro burger,,This is a great place for a late night burger.  The fries are like McDonald's fries (and I love McDonald's fries)
Craft,9,9,9,9,,,I've been here a few times and remember loving everything I've ever had.  This place made me a beet lover.  Everything is fresh.  Service is great and the ambiance is modern/warm.
Craftbar,6,6,6,7,,,This place was a little disappointing -- I feel like it's gone downhill a bit.  We came here recently and the food was very very average.  Don't think I'll be coming back.
Do Hwa,9,10,9,9,"dol sot bib bim bop, dukboki, pajun",,"One of my favorite all time restaurants.  I crave this food.  This is a great place if you want to introduce someone to Korean food and you don't want to take them down to K-town (which is a very good for food, but not so much for atmosphere or service = functional).  The food is authentic (I am Korean) and the atmosphere is modern -- they always have a fun movie playing on a blank wall (on mute)."
Five Points,8,8,8,9,fried chicken,,"This is a great place for brunch or dinner.  Service is great.  I came here once with a group of about 6 and were were about 15 minutes late in being seated.  To make up for this (which I didn't even think was a big offense), the server brought us a whole pizza on the house!  The fried chicken is great at brunch."
Jane,9,9,9,9,french toast,,This is a great place for brunch or dinner.  We typically have come here for brunch and the french toast is like dessert -- but not overly sweet.  Service is great -- we almost always get seated right away.
Les Halles,6,5,6,6,,,Overall this place is pretty average.  I've been here a few times and have gotten the steak frites which is pretty good.  Maybe the most exciting thing of place is that it's Anthony Bourdain's restaurant.
Mary's Fish Camp,6,7,5,6,,,"We went here only once after hearing rave reviews and seeing the lines that wrapped around the restaurant.  We got a lobster roll and while it was quite meaty, it was far too creamy/rich for my taste (I realize lobster is rich, but too much mayo)"
Mexicana Mama - West Village,7,7,7,7,guacamole,,"I don't remember what entrees I get here, but I think this place is good enough that I am generally ok paying $11 for guac.  That said, this place is a overpriced (but damn, the guac is good!)"
Oriental Garden,9,9,8,9,,,I like this place a lot.  I've been here several times and have loved everything I've ever ordered.  
Otto,9,9,9,8,"pizza, carbonara",,"This is a fun Mario Batali restaurant.  It's loud and lively and fun for a casual outing.  I love getting the cheese plate either to start or finish a meal.  Your cheese is accompanied by sour cherries, honey and one other thing I can't remember.  All the pizzas are delicious as are the pastas.  Never had a bad meal here."
Pearl Oyster Bar,9,9,8,9,lobster roll,,We went here after our experience after Mary's Fish Camp…  Far superior lobster roll -- much less creamy (mayonnaise-y).  It's a cozy atmosphere and great for a fun date night.
Raoul's,9,9,8,9,"pepper steak, frisse salad",,"Every time we come here we get the same thing.  It's pretty rare that my husband and I order the same thing, but the pepper steak is so good that we can't share!  The frisee salad is also delicious -- a soft boiled egg makes the dressing."
Shake Shack,7,10,5,7,burger,,"I gave the service a 7 only because we didn't really wait on line at all for our food, which was a bonsu (maybe because I was craving a burger at 10:45 in the morning).  This place has one of my favorite burgers in the city."
Spotted Pig,8,8,8,8,"blue cheese burger, chocolate torte, oysters, fries",,"We've been coming to the Spotted Pig for several years now and while the cliente has changed with the popularity of the place, the food is still delicious.  We come here and almost always sit at the bar and share a blue cheese burger (it's pretty rich).  The rosemary shoestring fries are delicious."
Sushi of Gari,8,9,6,8,,,"Unique sushi pieces, very fresh -- best in the city!"
Tortilla Flats,10,10,10,10,"the ""special"" gulf shrimp tacos, queso ",,"High scores here!  I love this place!  It's so fun and the owner is just crazy enough to have to love her.  Short story -- we came here one day with a bocce ball set (we were playing at the park) and the owner saw the set, squealed and ran to the back of the restaurant.  We weren't sure what was going on until she came back with a pitcher of sand!  We had a mini bocce tournament in the restaurant!  Anyhow, I crave the queso and the gulf shrimp tacos (which are always a ""special"") are delicious.  Bingo night is a must not miss!"
Wolfgangs,8,8,8,8,"steaks, tomato salad, sundae with schlag",,"This place is kind of an old school steak house.  The servers wear white jackets and the place sometimes feel like boys club.  The steak comes out on a big platter that meant to be shared.  On the side of your steak, you can have more meat.  The bacon is delish!  Chase it down with a beefsteak tomato mozzarella salad and top your meal off with an incredible sundae with a whipped topping (schlag -- i.e. the magic)"
