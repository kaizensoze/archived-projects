ABC Kitchen,7,7,8,7,donuts,,"Great ambiance, and innovative food.  The service was very attentive, and the crowd ranges from young and hip to older and more conservative.  I think it's a fun dining experience, and bought a gift card here for my boss, as a thank you gift."
Accademia di Vino,6,6,6,6,pasta,,"The ambiance was a little dead on a Friday night, but this is more of a reliable neighborhood staple.  Food is great, service is good, and atmosphere is casual and comfortable.  It's also a great place to do small plates and sharing if you have a group.  I was pregnant when I was there, so didn't get the chance to sample the wine list, but hear that it is also great!"
Annisa,8,9,6,9,,,"Was really excited to try this because of Anita Lo on Top Chef Masters.  The food was perfection.  This was more of a classic fine dining experience, which was surprising, given the more upbeat neighborhood.  It's a very small restaurant, white tablecloth, very formal and the dining room is very quiet during service.  The clientele on a Saturday night was older, which surprised me."
Asia de Cuba,6,6,6,6,lobster mashed potatoes,,"Have done several work dinners here, we love it for family style dining.  I always love the lychee martini here, great cocktails, and a good place to just meet someone for a drink.  Better with groups, ambiance is always lively."
Babbo,9,9,9,9,papardelle,,"The best of Mario Batali!  Impossible to get a reservation, but very worth the trouble.  The sommeliers take their jobs very seriously here.  The pasta is perfection.  It's perfect to do Babbo for a special occasion.  Great with a group or just a couple."
Back Forty,6,6,5,5,,,"A chill spot, great food, a little dark in the dining room."
Bar Americain,5,5,5,6,,,"Nothing special.  I expected more from Bobby Flay.  Granted, I went for a work event, and we were on a set menu.  But, the dishes were not innovative (tuna tartar, salmon, roasted chicken… yawn).  I much prefer Mesa Grill for a good Flay experience"
Barking Dog,6,6,5,4,bdnyc,,"I love Barking Dog for weekend brunch, but they don't take reservations, so there's always a long wait.  That said, food is always reliable and yummy.  Best to go when you want to do a brunch a little on the early side or mid-day"
Barney Greengrass,6,8,4,4,smoked fish,,"Great smoked fish, a classic for NYC.  But, I don't recommend eating-in, it's nothing special and a little dumpy.  Better to have them cater their famous platters, or takeout.  The breads, bagels, etc, are not special either.  So, I would only get smoked fish (which is amazing!) and has earned them their reputation.  They will rush you because they have very few tables and rely on constant turnover.  No reservations and on weekends, the wait can be long."
BCD Tofu,5,5,5,5,"bulgogi, bi bim bap",,"Great Korean BBQ and classic Korean food.  The service is standard, the ambiance is nothing special, but it's reliable for a good Korean meal."
Becco,5,5,5,5,pasta tasting,,"Great for pre-theater, they have tons of seating (two dining rooms) and will get you out on time.  The 3 pasta tasting is great, because the pasta is fresh and fast.  It's also unlimited, fantastic if you have teenage boys (bottomless pits)."
Blue Hill,8,8,7,8,,,"Great for a romantic dinner.  The clientele was older, so the ambiance is a little more quiet.  But, it has all the fine dining nicieties with some really great food!"
Blue Smoke,6,6,6,6,,,Great BBQ!  
Blue Water Grill,6,6,6,6,,,"Reliable for Union Square, though it sometimes feels like the restaurant that all NJ visitors go to.  Classic for ""my parents are in town.""  Food is fresh and good but not particularly special."
BONDST,6,6,6,6,,,"Had a great Restaurant Week menu.  I would compare to Nobu's sushi, just as good and fresh.  "
Buddakan,6,6,6,6,,,"Good for groups and sharing.  The restaurant is dark and hip, food is standard Asian fusion.  Good cocktails and a good bar scene."
Caracas Arepa Bar,6,8,6,5,,,"Amazing arepas!  But the service is bad, since they have very few seats and are always flooded with delivery/takeout orders.  I once waited an hour for a takeout order.  But, the arepas are the best!  Go at off-peak times, it's declicious!"
Cascabel Taqueria,7,7,7,7,guacamole,,"Great tacos and fun margarita flavors.  The guacamole is delicious and it's a fun, young, hip vibe, unusual for the neighborhood it's in."
Colicchio and Sons,7,7,7,7,,,"Feels like you're in a hunting lodge… in a good way!  Probably a nice cozy place for winter time.  Love the food, nice balance of comfort food favorites and inventive ""Colicchio"" dishes"
Commerce,7,7,7,7,baked tomato and eggs,,"Love brunch here!  Beautifully done, good people watching and it's on a quiet, very ""un-NYC"" block.  "
Cookshop,7,7,7,7,,,"Great brunch and dinner spot.  I think the food is amazing, and the ambiance is always fun.  Typical fare, but though the food was innovative and fun.  Always a great ambiance too"
Corner Bistro,6,8,6,6,bistro burger,,"Always a line, because it's one of the best burgers in NYC.  The ambiance isn't great, since there aren't many seats and it feels a little bit like a college bar.  But it's so worth it to cure any burger craving.  The only downside is the fries don't hold a candle to the burger.  I recommend asking for fries well done so you don't get soggy ones."
Craft,7,7,7,7,,,"Classic Collichio, love the muffins at the end for the next morning's breakfast. "
Craftbar,7,7,7,7,,,"Food is just as good as Craft, but better for groups and the crowd is more lively.  The wine selection is impressive here"
Da Andrea,7,8,6,6,,,"Classic Italian, but the food is perfectly done.  It feels like an old-school Italian family joint, very home-y décor and environment.  The staff is really nice and food is straightforward Italian."
DB Bistro Moderne,6,6,6,6,foie gras burger,,"Definitely go at least once for the Fois Gras burger.  But, it's also a great place for a business lunch/dinner.  "
DBGB,6,6,8,6,,,"Food was less exciting than it looked on the menu.  There are a lot of ""unique"" items, like blood sausages (?), so I stayed on the safe side.  Loved the space that it's in, very open, airy and lots of booths.  Big points for ambiance!"
Del Posto,9,9,8,8,"saffron pasta, celery ice cream dessert",,"Probably my favorite fine dining experience in New York.  Feels casual enough, even though it's got the prix fixe menu, white tableclothes, 4 waiters per table, purse stool, etc… The menu is genius, because there are choices for foodies (more adventurous), but they also have classic Italian choices for the less adventurous (my husband)... and all is done perfectly.  So, you will have a great, memorable meal, whether you order a classic bolognese or an innovative saffron pasta.  Definitely try that celery ice cream and goat cheese dessert that Sam Sifton writes about, it is so unusual and interesting!"
Demarchelier,7,7,6,6,"steak frites, coq au vain, frisee salad with lardons",,"Friendly neighborhood classic French food.  The pre fixe is such a good deal, includes wine.  They also have a lunch pre-fixe which is a great deal and equally delicious. Reservation is definitely recommended because it's a small place."
Dinosaur Bar B Que,6,7,6,6,,,Great BBQ!  Go with a big group so you can order lots!  College bar ambiance but very fun
Eleven Madison Park,6,5,7,7,lobster with truffle oil,white chocolate truffle,"Surprised that I didn't like this place more, since I'm a huge Danny Meyer fan.  There were high expectations though, because everyone has said this is their NYC fine dining favorite.  I loved the ambiance and décor… James Oseland was dining next to us when we were there.  But, some of the food was more adventurous than I wanted.  You don't get a choice, it's a seasonal pre-fix, so it's hard to know what's coming.  One course was caviar, which some in my party weren't into.  Lots of truffles used throughout, which felt like overkill.  Lots of little extras, but one of them was a white chocolate truffle... actually a truffle mushroom covered in white chocolate, which was surprising in a bad way.  Overpowering and a bad aftertaste from the otherwise nuanced meal"
Esca,6,6,6,6,"crudos, branzino",,"The seafood is so incredible.  A great spot for both raw and cooked preparations, love it"
Ethos,7,8,6,6,arni gouvetsi!,,"One of the best Greek spots in Manhattan.  I could eat the Arni Gouvetsi (lamb shank and orzo) any day of the week.  Service and ambiance aren't special, but the food is amazing!"
Gotham Bar and Grill,8,8,7,7,,,"Great fine dining for lunch or dinner.  Contemporary American fare, but always done perfectly."
Gramercy Tavern,8,8,8,8,,,One of my favorites in Manhattan!  Love that you will never have a bad meal at Gramercy Tavern!
Grimaldi's,8,8,7,7,,,A MUST if you love pizza.  I think it's worth the 45 minute minimum wait in a long line… and the ambiance is fun and family style
Haru - Upper East Side,4,4,4,4,,,"Not exciting, but reliable, standard, neighborhood Japanese.  Good for ordering in also"
Hundred Acres,8,8,8,8,,,"Amazing brunch, great ambiance, I love the layout of this restaurant.  They have an indoor garden area, which is a fun place to eat.  "
Ippudo,7,7,7,7,pork buns,,"Pork buns here are just like Momofuku.  Love the ramen, the only drawback is the long wait to get in"
Jane,5,5,5,5,,,"I believe they also own The Smith, which I think is better.  Ambiance for brunch was a little dead compared to Smith (surprising for the neighborhood).  Brunch was standard, but nothing special"
Jean Georges,8,8,7,7,,,"Classic fine dining.  I'm a big JG fan, and though the food was all perfectly prepared.  They have a great restaurant week menu at lunch time if you're looking for a  fine dining bargain"
Kunjip,6,6,5,5,,,"Yummy Korean food, ambiance is nothing to write home about"
La Esquina,8,8,8,8,,,"YUM.  Have done a private party here in the main restaurant and a weekday meal in the ""next door"" location.  Both are great.  The ambiance is intimate and cozy ""next door.""  Downstairs in the main dining room is fun, hip, lively, great for groups.  I am a Mexican food snob (from California) and think this is the best Mexican in the city!"
Le Cirque,7,7,7,7,,,"Sad to hear that Le Cirque is struggling financially, because I love the food!  It's less uptight than you would expect from the location and the type of food.  Common was dining there with a large party when I went.  The only annoyance is that men are required to wear a jacket to dine.  I think this is very old-fashioned and a little ridiculous in this day and age.  But, it didn't take away from the experience for me, I thought the food was exceptional."
Luke's Lobster,7,8,7,7,lobster roll,,"Great lobster rolls, always fresh.  Love the sustainable fishing aspect to the business.  It's communal seating and perfect for a quick, fresh bite"
Ma Peche,6,6,6,6,,banh mi,"Nice, innovative David Chang.  My only complaint is that he took too much liberty with the banh mi, it was small, bread was not that classic baoguette, and didn't resemble any banh mi I'd ever had.  But love the ambiance and Chambers hotel."
Maialino,7,7,7,7,egg ravioli,,"Love a runny egg, and the ravioli with raw egg inside was awesome.  "
Mama Mexico,4,4,4,4,,,"Mama Mex is only average ""wannabe Mexican"" food, in my opinion.  I liken the menu to a Chevy's, more Tex than Mex.  Ambiance is a little random too, with strange lighting and they always have mariachis around."
Minetta Tavern,5,4,5,5,,burger,"I was surprised I didn't love Minetta as much as I expected to.  As a burger-lover, I had very high expectations, and my burger came almost raw.  I love a bloody burger as much as the next, but this one bordered on being a steak tartare.  Not sure what everyone's talking about... i used to go to this neighborhood when I was 22.  I guess if you like bone marrow, it's supposed to be a good spot?  "
Momofuku Milk Bar,7,7,7,7,crack pie,,"Dangerous if you live nearby, because you can just swing in and pick up dessert any time.  Crack pie, cookies, all are delicious.  I'm not really into all the milk selections, but if you're into milk, I'm sure you'd appreciate it!"
Momofuku Ssam Bar,7,7,7,7,pork buns,,
Morimoto,7,7,7,7,"duck duck duck, omakase",,"Do the omakase if you can… amazing selection of Morimoto's best.  Otherwise, make sure to get duck duck duck, my favorite!  Morimoto himself is there often… great for parents when they're in town, they will get a big kick out of that!"
Norma's,8,9,7,7,huevos rancheros,,"The ambiance is great for people watching, but I love the brunch food any time of day.  Portions are enormous, so best to share with a group, so everyone gets something sweet and something with eggs"
Otto,6,6,7,5,,,"Pizza is just okay to me.  Thin crust, a little crunchy, not doughy at all.  Fun ambiance though, I love the stand-up bar area.  Service is annoying  because you can only order once (?) and they insist you order everything at one time.  A little random"
Palm,5,6,4,6,,,"Great steak, but again, feels like it's where the New Jersey crew dines on a Saturday night in Manhattan.  Lots of families dining together and lots of history to this place.  The waitstaff is all older, like 50+, and very funny… they will insist on giving you free dessert if they think it's your first time there"
Persephone,6,7,4,6,"greek salad, dolma",,"Great Greek food, delicious menu.  It's a great place to do a business lunch.  Unfortuantely, it doesn't get a lot of attention, and it's always dead inside… so the atmosphere is a little awkward, because you might be the only table eating there, this has happened both times I was there.  Too bad, because service is good, but it's a little too quiet so it feels like waiters are watching you"
Pipa,4,4,4,4,,,"Mediocre tapas, in my opinion, and a little overpriced.  It's a cute place, since it's part of ABC Home.  But I always leave that place hungry and feeling like the tapas are overpriced"
Quality Meats,5,5,6,6,,,
Rai Rai Ken,6,7,6,6,,,Great Ramen!  And a great neighborhood alternative to Ippudo though seating is tight and service is no-frills.
Red Rooster Harlem,8,8,8,8,"sweet potato doughnuts, mac and greens, helga's meatballs",,"Awesome cocktails (get Gin and Juice!) and bar scene.  Can't wait until they open the Nook (coffee, caps, pastries).  The perfect Marcus Samuelsson blend of Swedish and Southern comfort food.  Also great that they take walk-ins every night.  So, while getting a reservation is tough, just get there a little early on a weekday night and you'll definitely get in.  I have a feeling this is going to be one of my favorite standbys."
Resto,7,7,7,7,burger,,"yummy, cozy spot, always good comfort food"
Rosa Mexicano - Midtown East,6,6,6,6,,,"Reliable spot, food is always good and ambiance is lively.  Nice for a slightly upscale Mexican food experience.  Prickly pear margarita (YUM)."
Rouge Tomate,7,7,7,7,,,"Love the philosophy of this place, sustainable food in an very elegant presentation.  Great for a business lunch, after work drinks or dinner."
Sfoglia,8,8,8,8,,,"What a gem!  Hard to get a reservation, but delicious Italian food.  Gorgeous décor and very cozy spot"
Shake Shack - Madison Square Park,10,10,10,10,burger,,"Do you even have to ask?!?  Shake Shack is my perfect NYC burger and milkshake joint, and sort of my ""happiest place on earth"""
Shang,6,6,5,5,,,"High expectations of the food, given the celebrity chef, Susur Lee.  It was an unusual Asian fusion menu, but fun to try once.  "
Spice Market,7,7,7,7,,,"A standby for me, because the bar is always lively and I think the food is innovative and delicious"
Spotted Pig,6,7,7,6,burger,,"Great burger, interesting Brit-pub menu"
Supper,7,8,7,7,burata,,Delicious Italian food and have had a great weekend brunch there as well!
Sushi of Gari,5,5,5,5,,,"What's all the fuss about?  I didn't think Sushi of Gari was anything special.  Fish was very high quality, but it's very expensive for what you get.  Menu is not innovative at all… it is literally just different choices of sashimi.  I don't think they cook much there"
Tamarind,7,7,7,7,,,"Lovely upscale Indian food.  It's the kind of place I'd come back to over and over, and try all the different things on the menu."
Tao,6,6,5,5,kung pao chicken,,"Reliable slightly more refined Chinese food.  A great daily lunch special which is good for business lunches, though very filling."
The Modern,8,8,8,8,scallops,,"Danny Meyer favorite.  The scallops are incredible, highly recommended.  Love the Bar Room for after work drink spot.  The dining room is wonderful ambiance and all the food is delicious!"
The Smith,7,7,7,6,,,"Delicious for brunch!  Always good for a group, can be very crowded on weekends, but a fun place to people watch"
Tortilla Flats,5,5,5,5,,,"I think I liked this place when I was 22, for inexpensive drinks and mediocre Mexican food.  "
Union Square Cafe,6,6,6,6,,,"A fun restaurant, Danny Meyer's original.  Food was nice contemporary fare, and the service was great.  Ambiance is very traditional, would return more for the food"
Via Quadronno,6,6,6,6,great latte,,"Martha Stewart and I both love the lattes here, one of the best in NYC!"
Yama,6,8,6,5,,,"Great fresh fish, some of the best sushi in New York.  A little challenging to get a table, and the ambiance isn't anything more than a bustling sushi bar.  But I would go back any time for the sushi!"
