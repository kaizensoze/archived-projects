ABC Kitchen,9,8,10,4,"squash toast, scallops, beet salad, ravioli",whole wheat pizza,"Beautiful space really liked the light and airy decor, chandeliers and the cool plates and except for their whole wheat pizzas which were a little soggy, the food was excellent...especially the crab on toast, beet salad with yogurt, and the fish main courses. My favorite was the raw diver scallop appetizer (served in lime juice and green apple sauce) "
Aroma Kitchen & Wine Bar,7,7,7,9,"beet salad, pastas",,"Love it! Really great romantic cozy restaurant. Staff is very personable and attentive, but beware it's a very small space so you could be sitting on top of fellow diners. Food / menu creative and delicious - pastas are all homemade. Also good selection of cheap wines. "
Balaboosta,8,7,8,7,"carrot pizza, falafel, cauliflower, orecchiette pasta",,Small space and definitely require a reservation but a great spot to go to with friends so that you can order a host of their small plates. They were indeed small (and expensive) portions but very tasty and far surpassed the entrees in terms of quality and creativity. Only wish they had more of the falafel influence from taim.  Entrees were disappointing.
Basta Pasta,8,8,7,10,"pasta in a parmesan bowl, hankerchief pasta with lemon zest, asparagus with parmesean",,"A italian restaurant run by japanese people! Very fresh good, out of the box menu options that incorporate fresh ingredients and fresh seafood. The pastas are all homemade and prepared beautifully. The highlight is the fresh pasta tossed in a homemade parmesan wheel that they prepare tableside. Ambience is good, everyone who works there is very attentive but paper table cloths and flourescent lights are the crux of the decor. "
BONDST,6,6,8,5,"tofu appetizer, miso cod",,"Hosts and staff are rude, but probably with good reason and the restaurant is always packed with a very trendy crowd.  Most recommend the Omakase but if you arent looking for a scene there are probably better sushi spots in NYC with a much lower price"
Cafe Asean,7,6,8,7,"green curry, pad see yew",,"Very cute little gem for great Pan asian food in the village, in the summer they have a great garden area in the back. It's reasonable priced and has a comprehensive menu. The food is consistent and tasty. The service is attentive. "
Cookshop,8,9,10,7,"donuts, egg bake",,"Prefer Cookshop for brunch, it has a wide open sunny space with great dishes. The service can be random at times, sometimes they bring out all the food at once and sometimes one at a time. More of a comfortable restaurant to bring a group of friends. "
Dell'Anima,10,10,10,9,"brunch tasting,  pasta",,Only downside is that the restaurant is very very tiny and the kitchen is  very close to the dining room so this creates a very hot and cramped space for dinner. I would recommend it for brunch with a great tasting menu of savory and sweet italian brunch entrees. The service is fantastic for both meals 
Dhaba,6,6,5,5,"street bites, poori",british curries,"My favorite place in curry hill, the quality of the food tends to be a touch above the rest, the appetizers are good and the entrées not as greasy as the competition. One of the best parts is the indian street food that they have on the menu. The ambiance is even fun with colorful walls and bollywood music, and service that gets you in and out pretty fast"
ino,7,8,7,8,egg and asparagus,,"Very small room, but great Italian feel with the visible wine cellar. The quality of the food is great, best dish is the truffled egg toast. Lots of paninis so not so great for carb watchers "
Jaiya,8,7,6,8,"coconut soup, vermicelli spring rolls, green curry",,"Tasty, cheap, convenient location, large potions and never disapoints. Not a fancy thai restaurant but it has great execution of all the basics with authentic flavors"
Kefi,9,9,9,9,"branzino, spanakopita, greek pastas",,"Awesome, casual, Greek place with great prices and a huge menu selection. While it's known for the fish, don’t forget to try the greek pastas! The pace of the restaurant is frentic which is half of  the fun, the servers go by very fast but that’s part of the tavern feel. Favorite restaurant on the UWS. Also try the brunch!"
Kittichai,8,9,10,9,"curry, tofu apps, spring rolls, noodles, seabass",,"Some may call this place past it's prime, but it's a great space in a great location will well priced food and good quality of food. The space is wonderful and in the summer make sure to book a outside table. The service is always attentive and the cocktail list is really fun. A hidden surprise is the well priced brunch prix-fixe menu"
L'Artusi,10,10,10,10,"mushroom and egg, ricotta toasts, ricotta pasta, olive oil cake",,"Edges out its sister restaurant Dell Anima because of the bigger menu and bigger space. The wine list is extraordinary with wines in every budget, the mushroom and egg dish is not to be missed and all of the pastas never disapoint. This restaurant is versatile enough for dates, family dinners and client events.  Dishes are small but are built to be shared"
Locanda Verde,6,5,6,4,ricotta appetizer,pesto pasta,"Overrated, rude staff, totally overbooked, small cramped space. So unless you want mediocre food with a long wait, small portions and bad service you can skip this place. The only sunny spot is the take out bakery in the front. If you do go, order the fresh ricotta with orange toast. "
Paprika,8,7,8,8,peasant pasta,,"Great food and laid back. Standby dish is pizzocherri pasta but everything is very well made and don't think one entre is over $25. Even go there for brunch. Perfect neighborhood go-to italian joint."
Peels,9,10,8,9,"grilled cheese tea sandwiches, macaroni and cheese, baked eggs, grits",,"HIDDEN GEN, Despite the B health service score in the window, this is a fatty indulgence but try the grilled cheese sandwiches, baked eggs with spinach on grits and their soups. The food is great quality even if its not healthy and the décor and service is extemely trendy and cute. "
Shake Shack - Madison Square Park,10,10,4,10,"portabella mushroom burger, cheese fries",,"With more outposts opened up, you don't have to wait in line as long as you used to! The portabella mushroom burger is stuffed with cheese and then deep fried so it's just about the best thing on earth. "
Stanton Social,7,6,6,8,"grilled cheese, perogies",,"Huge menu, all the food is executed well but the room is very noisy and typically filled with large groups. The best part is that everyone can find something they like on the menu"
Tamarind Tribeca,6,6,8,5,malai kofta,"stuffed paneer, spinach subji","Very mixed on this place, for some reason the quality doesn't meet the standards set by the Gramercy location  but this space is much bigger, trendier and prettier. The service is very confused, the servers awkwardly linger, bring food out at random times and are not attentive. I think they overreached their  menu on this one adding ""creative"" dishes when they would  have been better served with the original  menu"
The Fat Radish,9,9,9,9,vegetable pot pie,root veggie mix,"Great food, great people, great space, it is really busy and fun and the food is delicious. One of the few bright spots in the LES that has great service and good abience. The menu is also inventive, especially  the celery pot pie"
Tortilla Flats,5,5,5,5,,,"Not great quality food, but great for a fun night out in a place that doesn't require any dignity. Be prepared for a place decorated in flammable christmas lights and streamers. The food is poor quality but it's not about the food, it's about the Bingo and the pitchers of margarita!"
Union Square Cafe,10,10,10,10,pasta,,"The consistently high quality of food, the ingredient and flavors make it one of the few restaurants of its caliber that are real deals. The service is very attentive and warm, almost feels like you are eating at someones home. All pastas homemade"
Viet Cafe,7,7,6,6,rice paper crepes,,"If you need a good quick bite in tribeca that’s somewhat healthier than Dean's pizza this is your place. Service is random, they seem to forget about you at times and the prices are quite high for neighborhood thai but it’s a pleasant place to sit with a menu full of  healthy veggie options"
