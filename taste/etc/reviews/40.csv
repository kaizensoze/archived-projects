Aldea,6,8,5,6,"octopus, lobster gazpacho, arctic char with yuzu and passionfruit",,"Hidden gem in Flatiron. While not inexpensive, we found the dishes to be expertly prepared and revealing subtleties that justify the price tag. "

Blue Hill at Stone Barns,8,9,7,7,,,"For the BHSB pilgrimmage, make the trip during the day to enjoy the farm and explore the facilities that Dan Barber has created on the expansive property. The meal is well-executed, harnessing the subleties that his fresher-than-fresh ingredients offer. Anything with eggs is a must-try! The clever amuse bouches at the beginning were some of our meal highlights, so don't overlook them! "
Casa Mono,8,8,8,7,"octopus, patatas bravas, casa mono salad",,A seat at the bar is the way to go for spectacular food and spectacle. 
Clinton St Baking Co,6,7,6,6,"biscuits, pancakes",,"What once held LES brunch in a lock is now one of many winners in the area. Get there early, or try Essex, Alias, or many other nearby spots. But you wont be able to find the biscuis elsewhere…"
Co.,7,7,7,6,,,"This trendy, new upscale pizza joint melds Italian classics with funky ingredients in an open/airy Chelsea locale. "
Da Andrea,6,7,6,5,"bolognese, octopus",,Hidden gem for low-key Italian
Dell'Anima,7,8,7,6,"octopus pasta, anything with mushrooms",,"The hype still surrounds this West Village Italia. Because its smaller than its sister L'Artusi, the best seats are the back, hidden outdoor ones. Come early in the summer to enjoy the people watching on West 4th while you have a glass of chilled Lambrusco. "
Dovetail,8,9,7,8,"foie gras, beef tenderloin, pain perdu",,"One of the best meals to be had in New York right now - inventive menu with the freshest of products. It’s a rare union of refinement and creativity, without being overly fussy. "
Extra Virgin,7,8,7,7,"truffle chicken, steak frites",,"If you can snag a table here, its one of the best all-around meals in the West Village. The prize seats are the outdoor tables in front of the restaurant with front row seats for people watching"
Fedora,7,6,7,7,"beet salad, chocolate cake",,Trendy West Village spot that as a newcomer is still finding its place and hard to get reservations. Fun scene on weekends
Gemma,7,6,7,7,"gemma salad, baked eggs",,A safe Sunday brunch choice - the banana bread and coffee get your Sunday off right
Gennaro,6,7,6,6,"pork ragu, polenta, shrimp salad",,"It's way the heck away for downtowners like me, but its worth the trip. The newly enlarged space means less waiting, more debating amongst the endless specials and compelling menu items. "
Gramercy Tavern,9,9,8,9,,,"One of the most consistent fine dining options in New York. The produce is first-rate, the creativity is exciting and fresh, and the execution is flawless. Service is perfect, including the scones and muffins for the next day's breakfast"
Ippudo,5,5,5,5,"noodles with pork, crepes",,"The lines speak for themselves in terms of the popularity of this spot, but personally I can't get overly excited. I enjoyed it, but after waiting for hours, I had exceedingly high expectations that were not met. "
Jack the Horse,7,7,7,8,,,Quaint Brooklyn Heights bistro with carefully executed dishes and friendly service
Jewel Bako,7,8,7,7,"anything with mushrooms, sashimi sampler",,"Jewel Bako has the feel of a flipped canoe, but the culinary offering of a clean, classy sushi outpost. Variety and flavors justify a suprising experience of sushi dining"
Joseph Leonard,6,5,7,6,,,"I understand they had a fire, and its part of the uber-trendy Jeffrey/JL/Fedora group, but this just wasn’t nearly as exciting as I had expected and hoped it would be…But it feels uber-New York, so they deliver on that part. "
Kanoyama,6,7,5,6,,,One of the most authentic Japanese restaurants in NYC with exotic fish options. Make reservations to avoid the wait
Kingswood,7,7,7,7,"lamb ragu, mac n' cheese, octopus",,"Love the vibe at this spacious, comfortable spot. Known for its burger, the lighter dishes are also winners"
L'Artusi,6,6,7,6,"lemon pasta, vegetable sides",,"One of a few newish uber-happening Italian spots in West Village. The vibe is as enticing as the food. Excellent upstairs wine library, perfect for groups. "
Laut,5,6,5,5,pad see yew and mango salad,,"Good spot for a weeknight dinner, a casual southeast Asian restaurant"
Lil' Frankie's,6,7,6,6,"lemon pasta, pizzas, mozzerella salad",,"Uber-reliable for value - pizzas, salads and pastas of the same quality as Franks or Supper, but in a more casual environment. Best seats are in the back garden"
Lotus of Siam,6,7,6,6,"thai beef salad, seabass pad see yew",tom yum goong,"Newcomer in the old Cru space, certainly overpriced for what it is. "
Luke's Lobster,5,8,4,4,lobster roll,,"A transcending buttered roll with perfectly seasoned lobster and the right mayo-lobster chunk ratio. A fabulous find, but be ready to take it to go"
Maialino,7,8,7,7,"fried artichokes, cacio e pepe, malfatti di maialino, gelato",,"The bar area is sufficient for discovering the unique offering of maialino. It almost makes you feel like you are back in Italy at the old wooden tables with simple, fresh, perfectly al dente pastas."
Marea,9,9,9,8,"lobster and burrata, fusilli with octopus and bone marrow, lafrieda steak, affogato",,"Michael White's blockbuster restaurant - be ready for a big night out, for your wallet and food repertoire. Inventive, challenging and delcious. "
Mermaid Oyster Bar,6,7,6,6,"calamari salad, lobster roll, half n' half poboy",,"The sister restaurant of Mermaid Inn is bustling and loud, with an attractive happy hour Oyster deal. All things on a roll were enjoyable, and this spot doesn’t have the wait that Pearl Oyster or Mary's Fish Camp have. All in, a strong additio to the NY quasi-seafood shack scene.  "
Momofuku Milk Bar,5,6,4,4,soft serve,"cakes, pies","The creativity started strong, but they have yet to innovate further in Ko's dessert parlour. They also just converted the space to an even smaller Milk Bar making squeezing in to order a task.  The cakes and pies are beyond cloyinly sweet"
Morandi,7,7,8,7,"grilled vegetables, egg dishes, spring pea salad",,Another West Village Italian that differentiates itself through convivial atmosphere and solid italian fare. Best seats are out front during the warm weather months
Northern Spy Food Co.,5,6,5,5,,,"Best spot is the back booth, perfect for date night"
Peels,6,5,6,6,"cinnamon bun, eggs with greens",,"Best for brunch, great light in the morning and can sample the amazing cinnamon bun!"
Peter Luger,7,8,8,6,"original steak, hot fudge sundae",,"Despite the Wolfgang's offshoots proliferating in Manhattan, nothing compares to the orginal Luger's experience in terms of food or environment. An evening or late lunch at Luger's followed by a walk back to Manhattan across the Williamsburg Bridge, soaking in the NY skyline, is one of NY's most invigorating experiences. "
Picholine,8,8,8,8,,,"Serving a primiarily older clientele with classic French haute cuisine, Picholine provides one of the most authentic hors-France experiences to be had in NYC.  Terrence Brennan's first cheese inroads were made here before he moved on to Artisanal."
PJ Clarke's,6,6,6,6,chocolate tollhouse pie,,"I would be lying if I pretended to love this place for anything other than the decadent, warm Tollhouse chocolate chip pie with melting vanilla ice cream. It's as American as the burger, but for the sweet tooth, not the carnivore. "
Prune,7,8,7,7,,,"One of the landmark East Village restaurants that rightly put the East Village on the map for foodies in NYC and futher afield. True to its roots, it still offers the best quality ingredients prepared in tantalizing, creative new ways - allowing for its perpetual success. "
Red Rooster Harlem,6,6,7,6,"cornbread, mac n cheese, salmon, meatballs",,"Fascinating hybrid Southern/Swedish menu, only Samuelsson could pull this off! "
Rye,7,7,7,7,,,"Newcomer to Williamsburg, interesting menu and solid execution. Perfect for a weeknight dinner in the hood"
Sala One Nine,6,7,6,6,"patatas bravas, meatballs",,Reliable tapas spot with sangria and the usual tapas suspects. 
Seasonal,7,8,6,7,anything with spaetzle,,"Upscale Austrian in a quiet environment, attracts Midtown tourist crowd. Wallse is my preferred upscale Austrian "
Sorella,7,7,7,7,,,"The hip young staff, daring Northern Italian menu, and intriguing wine list make this Emma Hearst debut a success. She has now matched it with Stellina, the neighboring gelato bar that we all were craving. The chocolate sorbet is heavenly. A well-suited pairing for a girls night out in the LES"
Spotted Pig,7,7,9,6,gnudi,,"The ambiance is what really makes this spot great, but it comes with the all the hoopla of April Bloomfield and usually a wait. But when I think about it, my favorite Spotted Pig moments are at the bar, in the midst of the hoopla. "
Supper,8,9,8,7,"panzanella, bolognese, eggplant marinara",,One of the best dining values in NYC. Be preprared to wait - its worth it! 
Sushi Seki,4,5,4,4,,,"I still do not get this place's reputation - seems like generic sushi, tasty and unpretentious, but not what I had expected given the hype"
Telepan,8,9,7,8,"veal sausage cannelloni, s'mores dessert",,"The prix fixe menu here is one of the best reasons to dine Upper West. Bill Telepan has been consistent in his high-quality, inventive menus, while somehow remaining somewhat under the radar. Brunch is also fantastic "
The Fat Radish,7,7,7,6,beet crumble,,"My first interaction with the Beet Crumble was one of immediate infatuation. This is the best dish on the menu, if you are a beet person. I cant justify going back for much else, as the rest of the menu has underwhelmed me. The setting is similar to Kingswood (same owners), but with a LES twist. "
The Red Cat,7,8,6,6,"heirloom tomato and feta salad, cioppino ",,One of the early entrants to West Chelsea and still one of the best options in the area. The interesting side dishes compliment the varying menu. I can always rely on the freshest produce and worth-saving-room desserts.
The Smith,7,7,8,7,"brussel sprouts, avocado salad, pumpkin salad, french toast",,"One of the most successful newcomers to the East Village in recent years. The Smith is always packed and yet, never seems to falter in delivering well-executed, if not straightforward, food. They throw in a few eclectic menu items to spice it up - like Bim Bim Bap - but stick with the basics. The salads, brussel sprouts and mussels are winners, as are the decadent sundaes for desserts."
Uva,7,7,8,7,"truffle-robiola flatbread, salads",,Upper East could use about a dozen more Uvas. The garden and dowstairs wine cave are the best spots in the house to savor the truffle-robiola flatbread and excellent salads. Great for a girls dinner with reasonably priced bottles of wine and shared plates. 
Via Quadronno,5,4,7,5,,,"Shockingly overpriced for what it is. If you want to come to enjoy the Upper East side scene, just grab a coffee at the front tables and forego the underwhelming food. "
Wallse,7,7,7,7,,,"The first of this Austro-NY Empire is also the most upscale. The food is excellent, and setting is more romantic than Blaue Gans or Café Kristall. Its Midtown rival Seasonal also does excellent Austrian fare. "
Westville - West,6,7,6,6,"brussel sprouts, artichokes",,"When I lived in France for a time, I used to pine for Westville's veggie plate with my four top choices: artichokes, brussel sprouts, beets, and butternut squash. Mentally construct your own from the myriad fresh options as you wait in line. Those in the hood are wise to order delivery to avoid the wait! The turkey burgers, grilled cheese and other comfort foods are hits as well. There are now three locations, with the original West Village location being the smallest and least hospitable. "
