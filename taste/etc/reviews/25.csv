Alta,7,8,7,7,brussel sprouts,,"A great little tapas restaurant by W4th. Despite a pretty big space, they manage to maintain an intimate ambiance with lighting and strategicaly spaced tables. A great place to go with a big group of 8 or more - you can order the ""big shebang"" and get one of everything on the menu! ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bubbys,7,7,7,7,"banana cream pie, chicken salad sandwich, mozzerella and pesto sandwich",,"One of DeNiro's outposts in TriBeca, Bubby's delivers good food and great pie. Try the half sandwich, cup of  soup combo for a satisfying lunch choice. This place can get crowded, though, so sometimes it is worth calling ahead before heading over. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Penelope,8,8,9,7,"cupcakes, penny egg sandwich, sam I am",,"A good go to brunch place, this quiant restaurant makes you feel like you are eating in someone's home. With mismatched coffee mugs and flatware, but always solid food, this is a good pick when you're looking for a relaxed meal with good company. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Peter Luger,10,10,10,10,"porterhouse, german fries, bacon, apple streudel",,"YUM. This NYC classic always delivers if you are looking for a no-frills steak dinner. Make sure to start the meal with some tomatoes (and onions if you like them) slathered with Peter Luger's famous steak sauce and end with some dessert with a good heaping of ""schlag."" Whether you go to the Long Island or Brooklyn outpost, though, make sure to bring enough cash with you. They don't accept credit cards. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Smith,8,8,9,8,mac + cheese,,"A good standard for a group of people, The Smith is a reliable comfort food eatery. With a sprawling footprint, lively décor, and pretty hip clientele, this place is a good pick for weekend brunch or late night eats. Don't forget to snap a memory in the photo booth downstairs. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Totto Ramen,8,10,5,8,miso ramen,,"If you're willing to wait for a superbly tasty bowl of ramen, and willing to forego the typical trappings of NYC eateries, this is a good place to go. Make sure to put your name on the clipboard hanging outside once you get to the door, and despite waiting for a long time, don't be surprised if you feel pressured to dine in a flash. The ramen truly is excellent, though. So if you have the time to spare, it is worth the wait. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wolfgangs,7,9,3,6,"porterhouse, bacon, apple streudel",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Basically a Peter Luger's in the city, you come here for the steak. It is delicious. But the restaurant itself is too loud and crowdedfor the experience to be that enjoybale. You'll have a better dining experience at the Peter Luger out in Brooklyn, or even on Long Isalnd, but if you are not willing to make the trek, Wolfgang's midtown location and excellent food makes up for it.
