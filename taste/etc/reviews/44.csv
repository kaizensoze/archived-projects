Reservations can still be a bit of a pain to get, but it's well worth the pain or wait.  Both tasting menus are sure to please and I always have the most fun when I go in groups because then everyone gets a different dessert at the end and it's the most amazing dessert sampler!!"Da Andrea,8,9,7,7,"prosciutto buns, parpadelle with pork ragu",,Used to be on Hudson and now in a larger location near Union Square but still extremely reliable with some of the best value dishes.  If you're there and they have the cioppino Ð you have to get it!Ippudo,7,8,8,6,"pork buns, red based ramen",,"The biggest drawback to this place is the WAIT Ð ugh!  Some think it's overpriced Ð I might agree with that a bit, but it's still a damn good bowl of ramen!"Jean Georges,10,10,10,10,"valhrona chocolate cake, summer tomato/watermelon",,Classic NYC establishment and absolutely perfect for a romantic occasion or celebration.  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu and service is always top notch and a true five-star!Joseph Leonard,7,8,6,7,,,"Great place for brunch, although the wait can be a bit of a pain.  Best to get there around 1130am if you're able to be up that early!"Pomodoro Rosso,8,9,8,8,"salads, pasta con salciccia, seafood linguini",,One of my favorite neighborhood restaurants and was so happy when they increased their space to the back.  Great alfresco dining as well and portions are HUGE!  Focaccia bread is also delicious and service is very reliable.  House red is also delicious!Spitzer's Corner,7,7,8,5,"brussel sprouts, sliders, mac and cheese",,Definitely not a date place Ð but great place for a girls' night out and group of friends.  It's quite a meat market here and known for it's beers on tap Ð but the gastropub food is actually quite good and tasty as well!  And the scene can be very entertaining...
