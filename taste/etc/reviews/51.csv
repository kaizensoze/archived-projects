Blue Hill,10,10,9,10,,,"Perfection in food and service. The dining room is a little too dark for my liking, but that's a small price to pay for the delicious food."
A Voce Columbus,9,9,9,9,,,Great place for celebrating with friends or a special date night out. Try to get a seat by the window for a great view of Columbus Circle below. Upscale Italian food done right.
ABC Kitchen,8,8,9,8,"crab toast, roasted chicken",pizzas,Great airy ambience. You can feel good about the local ingredients used in the fresh tasting dishes.
Babbo,7,8,7,7,,,"I went here such a long time ago… the food was good, but I was made to feel that if you weren't ""someone"" you got put in the back at a not-so-great table by the swinging doors to the kitchen."
Back Forty,7,8,7,8,"crab boil, burgers",,Great place for a burger and beer with friends.
Balthazar,8,8,9,8,bread basket,,A nice spot for breakfast or brunch. Go to be seen while you linger over your cappuccino and New York Times.
Bar Boulud,7,7,8,9,"pates, charcuterie",,Cool space for a pre-Lincoln Center dinner for two or a quiet night out. 
Barbuto,9,10,9,9,everything,,"Make sure you order a lot of dishes and share with the table, Waxman's food is elevated comfort food done right."
Basta Pasta,8,8,7,8,"spaghetti with parm and prosciutto, squid ink pasta",,"Great Japanese Italian, delicious pastas. Not the place to go If you want quiet, but if you don't mind some noise the food won't disappoint. "
BLT Fish,9,10,9,9,"red snapper, hen of the woods mushrooms",,My favorite seafood restaurant in the city. I love that you can get a whole fish and add on the sides and sauces that you want. They also have a beautiful private function room (where we had our rehearsal dinner).
Blue Hill at Stone Barns,10,10,10,10,,,The food is so fresh (and close to the source) and it shows (in the taste and presentation). The space is beautiful (though I wish it was little more rustic).
Blue Water Grill,7,7,8,8,,,The food is solid but if you're in the Union Square area there are a lot better options.
Brgr,6,7,6,6,milkshakes,,Good place if you're looking for a quick bite or something to take to go. You can feel safe eating the meat knowing that it comes from a reliable souce.
Carmines - Midtown,7,7,7,7,,,"Good place for large groups, but be prepared to feel like a tourist. The food is good for what it is: enormous family-style portions of generic Italian food."
Citrus Bar and Grill,7,7,7,7,,,If you're into fusion-y sushi this is the place for you. 
Community Food and Juice,8,9,8,5,dessert,,My go to in the Columbia neighborhood. The food is great and they use local ingredients when possible. Their only downfall: the service can be not so hot.
Cookshop,9,9,9,9,salads,,"Cookshop does great starters, salads, and dessert, but I often skip the main courses in favor of two starters. Their ingredients are fresh and the seasonal menu is always changing."
Dinosaur Bar B Que,7,7,7,7,,,"Great for groups, a fun place to take out of towners (as long as they're not visiting from somewhere that's known for BBQ)"
Eleven Madison Park,10,10,10,10,,,"It's a four star restaurant for a reason, and it shows in every single detail. My only complaint is that the over-attentive service can  be a little stifling."
Esca,9,9,9,9,,,"Delicious pasta and seafood, my favorite Batali spot in NYC."
Fairway Cafe,8,10,6,8,"big boy special, egg salad sandwich",,"This place is a hidden gem on the UWS. If you don't mind the fact that it's situated inside a busy supermarket, you will be treated to fresh, simple, delicious food. It's a go to brunch spot seeing as most other places in the neighborhood have long lines that are not worth the wait."
Fatty Crab,7,7,7,7,,,"Over-hyped in my opinion. But, if you're in the mood for some greasy Southeast Asian street food it will satisfy your craving. "
Five Napkin Burger - Upper West Side,6,7,6,7,,,"The burgers are too big, and fries are not that great. For the price, you can get a much better burger in this city."
Gennaro,6,6,7,8,,,"Generic Italian, nothing to write home about."
Gobo,8,8,7,7,"hot spiced bean curd stir-fry, pine nut vegetable medley with lettuce wraps, yam fries",,"Good vegetarian Asian food. Sometimes it can bit little too salty, but all the more reason for you to order one of their delicious fresh-squeezed juice combinations."
Golden Unicorn,8,8,7,6,,,A Chinatown/dim sum go-to. Make sure you go early or the good things will be gone.
Gotham Bar and Grill,8,8,9,10,,,
Gramercy Tavern,10,10,10,10,tasting menu,,"Great for a night out to celebrate (we go every year on our anniversay). If you don't have a reservation, you can snag a table at the more casual ""Tavern"" area in front of the bar."
Grimaldi's,9,9,8,8,,,"Delicious pizza if you're willing to wait in line with a bunch of tourists. If you can, avoid the weekends."
HanGawi,9,9,10,10,,,"One of the best Korean places in Korea town. All vegetarian, with healthy options like brown rice. Great for a small get together with friends or a double date. Be prepared to remove your shoes."
Haru - Upper West Side,6,6,7,7,,,Not so great sushi in a city where there is lots of great sushi.
Jane,9,9,9,9,,,A lovely option for dinner when you feel like a good meal that doesn’t have to be a production. They also have a  nice private room downstairs for a small gathering/dinner party.
Kajitsu,10,10,9,10,,,You feel like you could be in Japan when you eat at this tiny place specializing in vegetarian kaiseki. I still fantasize about my meal here when I'm craving good Japanese food. 
Kefi,8,8,8,8,"spreads, grilled octopus, grilled branzino",,"Solid Greek food, good for groups but make sure you have a reservation or you will wait. My only complaint is that they don't ever change the menu so if you go a lot it can get boring."
Landmarc - Columbus Circle,8,8,7,8,pain perdu,,"Solid, casual fare in the Time Warner Center. Has a reputation for being kid-friendly (and it is) so be prepared to sit among lots of kiddies. "
Le Colonial,9,9,9,9,,,"Delicious Vietnamese in a somewhat unfortunate location, but if you work in midtown it's prefect for meeting people after work."
Locanda Verde,9,9,9,8,"blue crab crostini, roast chicken for two",,"If you can get over the fact that the people seating you think they are way more important than they are, the food is great, though heavy on the meat. The place is large but structured so that you don't feel that way. Good for a small groups or a date night."
Marea,8,8,9,10,,,"Over-hyped in my opinion. The food was good but not as good as I was expecting for the price/reputation. Also, the menu is too complicated, I would prefer fewer options done better. The service is great, the décor leaves something to be desired with lots of uber modern sculptures that clash with the more tasteful shell decorations."
Markt,7,7,7,7,,,Great for a steaming hot bowl of mussles and cold beer on tap if you're in Chelsea and looking for a lunch spot.
Matsuri,9,9,10,9,"deep fried sea bass, unagi pie",,"The cavernous space is quite fun, and the signature cocktails are delicious. I'm not usually one for fusion when it comes to my Japanese food, but here it's done with a light enough touch that the food still feels authentic."
Momofuku Milk Bar,8,8,7,7,"compost cookie, soft serve",,A good place to go for dessert if you've had dinner in the area. Some of the best soft serve in a city saturated with frozen desserts.
Morimoto,7,7,8,8,,,"Not great, but I'm also a purist when it comes to my Japanese food. "
Nam,9,9,9,9,monkfish,,"Great Vietnamese food in a small, quiet space. Good for a date night or a double date with friends."
Ocean Grill,8,8,8,8,,,"Solid brunch or dinner choice on the UWS. They have an extensive menu (raw bar, sushi, cooked dishes) so you should be able to find something to please everyone in your group."
Omen,10,10,9,10,,,"Best Japanese in NYC, hands down. Every bite is carefully crafted and authentic. Be prepared to pay a premium, but it's worth it. Good for an intimate dinner with 2-4 people."
Otto,8,8,8,5,olive oil gelato,,"Good for groups, the pizza and pasta is always tasty and the olive oil gelato is one of my favorite desserts in the city. The only negative is that the people who seat you are terrible (e.g. I was pregnant and the restaurant was empty and all but one person in our group had arrived but they still wouldn't seat us)"
Popover Cafe,6,6,6,7,,,If you like popovers you will like the brunch (all dishes come with a popover) but aside from that novelty there is much better food to be had just a few blocks away.
Pulino's Bar and Pizzeria,7,7,7,7,,,I was expecting more from this place when it opened. The pizzas aren't bad but they don't wow either. I haven't had the meat so I can't speak to that.
Robataya,9,10,9,9,,,Delicious Japanese grilled small plates. The portions are small and pricey but worth it. Definitely sit at the counter.
Rosa Mexicano - Lincoln Center,7,7,7,7,,,"Good food, but not worth the price in my opinion. The guacamole made at the table is a bit gimmicky, this one's better left to the tourists."
Rouge Tomate,9,9,9,10,,,Impecable food that won't make you feel guilty for eating it. Spa cuisine elevate to haute cuisine. Great for a night out with the girls.
Salume,8,8,8,8,salame di cioccolato,,"Delicious, fresh sandwiches, but the portions are not that big. Don't skip dessert."
Shake Shack - Madison Square Park,8,9,7,7,"shack burger with cheese, shakes, concretes",shroom burger,"Best ""fast food"" burger in the city. Just the right size, juciy meat, soft bun. Don't forget to ask for lettuce and tomato on your burger if you want it. The custard is delicious the concretes are heaven (my favorite is the Upper West Slide). If you're not a shake person, get an Arnold Palmer instead. Vegetarians, skip the deep fried 'shroom burger which is way too heavy on the cheese, and get the cheese friends insead, they're great."
Soba - Ya,9,10,9,8,"kabocha, kimpira gobo, agedashi tofu, soba dishes",,Best mid-range Japanese in the city. The soba is divine and the appetizers are all delicious.
Spotted Pig,9,9,9,9,burger with roquefort,,One of the best burgers in the city. Great pub ambiance but be prepared to wait at peak times.
Sushi of Gari,9,9,8,8,,,"Delcious sushi, but not cheap. If you want bang for your buck get one of the sushi platters. If you can afford it, sit at the counter and order the omakase."
Sushi Seki,9,9,8,8,,,Solid sushi in an awkward neighborhood. Some of the best rolls in the city.
Tamarind Tribeca,8,8,8,9,,,"I won't say the food is bad, as it's not, but I am not a fan of Indian food that is too ""composed,"" I prefer to share several bowls of things and eat with my hands a little, and I would feel weird doing that here."
Tanoreen,9,10,6,8,,,"If you're willing to make the trek, the food is delicious. Bring your appetite and your friends, portions are huge and dishes are best shared."
Telepan,9,9,9,10,,,A great place for quiet meal. Refined farm to table as its best.
The Mermaid Inn,9,9,8,8,lobster sandwich,,My go to casual dinner spot on the UWS. They have a great dinner special that comes with a  free beer if you can get there early enough. Everything on the menu is delicious and they have a variety of raw oysters to choose from If that's your thing.
The Red Cat,8,8,8,8,,,"Good new American, but not great. Nothing to really differentiate itself from other places in the neighborhood."
