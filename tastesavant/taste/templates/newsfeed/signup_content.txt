Hi there,

Welcome to Taste Savant! We are a highly curated restaurant discovery site
designed to help you decide where to eat out next. Here are a couple tips to
get you started:

1. Fill out your profile on the site. This will help others in the community
get to know you and your food preferences.

2. Make friends by following other people on the site so that you can build
out your community and get reviews from people you trust. You can find your
real friends on Taste Savant if you've logged in with Facebook or you can make
new friends.

3. Have something to say? Write reviews on restaurants you've been to by
clicking on the "Review Now" tab on the restaurant pages.

4. Come back often. We add new critic and user reviews everyday, so the site
is always changing. Visit us often to keep updated on what's new!

As a reminder your username is {{ username }}

If you have any questions, you can always refer to our FAQs
(http://www.tastesavant.com/FAQs) or email us at admin@tastesavant.com.

Thanks and Enjoy!
The Taste Savant Team
