Momofuku Noodle Bar,7,7,7,6,steamed pork buns,fried chicken dinner,"Lucky us, we were able to snag one of the coveted fried chicken dinner reservations on Christmas Eve.   Our party of 8 arrived promptly at 5:30 pm and waited amidst others outside waiting to be let in for the night's first seating.   We were seated at one of the long (usually communal) tables in the center of the dining room/hall, and ordered a round of momofuku soju slushies (""a yuzu palmer"") that  was awesome.  Before the chicken dinner began, we ordered 2 plates of each the steamed pork buns and steamed shrimp buns.  Both were amazing, and the shrimp ones interestingly made with a shrimp patty (cake like but with chunks of shrimp).  We also had the special appetizer hamachi collar bone (tastes like sushi hamachi but cooked, and quite oily). Then came the chicken - two whole fried chickens (but into pieces), one southern style and one korean style, served with sides of mu shu pancakes, bibb lettuce, four sauces and an assortment of seasonal vegetables (carrots and radishes).    The southern style chicken was hard fried, and a bit on the salty side, while the korean style was good though could have been crispier.  The sauce too was spicy and predominantly flavored by korean chili paste (gojuchang) and fell a little flat. Nonetheless, the sides and overall experience were great.  Packed house, plenty of food, and a warm buzz on a chilly NY winter night.  What could be better? "
