Accademia di Vino,8,8,8,8,"scallop appetizer, white truffle oil pizza",,Great place to meet up with friends for a glass of wine or dinner.  Excellent food…with a lot of choices on the menu.  Authentic Italian-speaking staff. Very crowded.
A Voce Columbus,9,10,9,7,"brussel spouts, riccota appetizer, pasta",,"Best brussle sprouts and pasta in NYC...and everywhere else for that matter!  Lively, modern-Italian atmosphere.  I highly recommend ordering a bunch of pasta from their menu for the first course and sharing it around the table.  Each one is better than the next and will probably influnce your main course dinner option! "
