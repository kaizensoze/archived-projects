The focus is certainly on the food- but we loved the appetizers much more than the main courses.  Everything tasted fresh and had that ""from the farm"" feel.  We specifically loved how the veggies were done- well-seasoned without comprimising the actual flavor or texture of the vegetable."ﾋpizz,9,9,8,9,polenta,,"We came here on an impromptu dinner with friends and ended up loving the food here.  Itﾕs a bit formal with nice, but not out of the ordinary d残or.  The food was creative and fresh-tasting.  Itﾕs a midtown-style restaurant in the LES"Aquavit,8,8,10,10,vegetarian tasting menu,,"We had the vegetarian tasting menu here a few years back and while the ambiance and service were exceptional we found the food to be somewhat lacking.  The dishes were creative, but not at all comparable to the other high-end vegetarian tasting menus we have had in the city."Bar Pitti,8,8,8,7,artichoke pasta,,Itﾕs a great casual restaurant with a nice west village feel.  Itﾕs the place to go for good food and great company.  The service is always rushed and sometimes getting a table can be difficult.  The crowd is very European.  I would suggest dinner vs. brunch- but overall the food is great if you can deal with the service and long waits for a table.Blue Ribbon Brasserie,7,7,7,7,,,"We came here without a reservation on a rainy Friday night.  We waited 2 hours at the bar for very mediocre food.  We are vegetarians and there was limited selection for us- however, the dishes our friends ordered (carnivores) looked great, and they were pleased with the food.  Its quite expensive, and for the slow service and overdone decor, I didn't find it worth my while."Bombay Talkie,7,6,7,7,,,"I used to live in Chelsea, so I've been here a few times.  The food is good, but nothing extra ordinary.  The best part is the ambiance and creative cocktails they serve.   Itﾕs a great place for some casual drinks with friends."Bouley,8,8,9,9,,,"We came here for my birthday last year and had a great time.  The vegetarian tasting menu was excellent, but they took over 30 min per course- and for 5-6 courses it just took WAY too long.  "Cafe Boulud,9,9,9,10,,,"This is our favorite ""fancy / occasion"" restaurant in NYC.  The ambiance is formal without being uptight and service is excelent without being overbearing.  The dishes are always a treat. In fact, when we ordered the vegetarian tasting menu they provided us with separate dishes for every course"Cafe Habana,5,5,5,5,,,"NYC-ers tend to rave about this over-crowded place.  We, however thought the corn on the cob was wayyy over buttered and soggy and the main dishes were nothing to wait 1 hour for.  "Daniel,10,10,10,10,,,As far as formal dining goes- we LOVE Daniel.  Its great food paired with opulent d残or and fantastic service to match.  We were also greeted the chef himself as he made rounds to all of the guests.  We were clearly the youngest diners that night- but its always nice to take a trip outside the normal circuit for a quality meal.Dirt Candy,7,7,7,8,grits,,"Itﾕs a small restaurant with clean and simple d残or.  The dishes are great, but there is not a ton of flavor.  The portions are somewhat small, so the bill gets pretty high for a casual-type of restaurant"Do Hwa,9,9,9,8,soft tofu stew,,We love the vibrancy of this West Village korean place.  Its always filled with young NY-ers in their 20-30's.  The food is great - I would recommend this place for group dinners or date nights.  The drinks are quite tasty as well.
