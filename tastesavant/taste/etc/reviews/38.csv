A Voce Columbus,7,7,6,7,"straticiatella, pastas, bombolini ",,"Good, standard expense account dinner spot. The food is great, and the décor is nice, but the size somehow makes it devoid of charm, particularly vs. the madision location. They do have great private rooms in case you have an event to go to. "
A Voce Madison,8,8,8,8,"straticiatella, pastas, bombolini ",,"Much more intimate than its uptown location, and the original really hits the spot. Food is great, as is the wine list and service. Great for date nights and double dates in particular."
Abboccato,6,7,6,6,pasta,,"The food is really great here, and it is a great place to go pre/post theater. Ambiance is good for a theater dinner spot, but nothing to write home about other than that. Overall pretty solid. "
ABC Kitchen,9,9,9,9,,,"I love this place. The ambiance/décor is wonderful. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and the food is outstanding. I think the appetizers are far better than the entrees, so would suggest ordering tons of them for the table. The organic/eco friendly vibe is on point without being in your face. The only downside with this place is how hard it is to get a reservation. "
Accademia di Vino,3,3,3,3,,,"With so many wonderful options in the city, why go here. "
Aquavit,7,7,7,7,,,"Great, high end scandanavian with a great prix fixe and lunch menu. Tons of vegetarian options as well which is rare in midtown. Really good if you want something different. The bar is great in case you want to meet someone for a drink as well"
Arturo's Restaurant,7,8,6,6,"pizza, calzone",,"Great pizza, but much better to eat in than take out. There are a lot of great pizza options in NYC these days, but this is one of the greats. Good for a casual family/friend pizza dinner."
Babbo,9,9,9,9,,,"What hasn't been said about Babbo? It is absolutely outstanding, with creative pastas and delightful service. The bar is great for walk-ins as well. Its an absolutely awesome and memorable experience."
Balaboosta,8,8,8,8,,,"It’s a great light dinner spot by the same folks who own Taim, the fantastic falafel joint. I think the place is great. I think the appetizers & sides are significantly better than the main dishes, so go overweight those."
Balthazar,6,6,8,7,pastries,,"Balthazar is outrageously over-rated. Its fine for breakfast, but the food is mediocre across the board. A much better bet is to go the café next door for some great coffee and the best donut in NYC."
Bar Pitti,5,6,7,3,,,"Food is fine, but the real reason to come is the scene, particularly the sidewalk in the summer. The owners know it though and rip you off every chance they get (constant upsells etc). They also try to turn the tables as quickly as possible and are perpetually rushing you out. Don't expect a leisurely dinner, but you will get some eye candy."
Bar Stuzzichini,6,7,5,6,,,"Surprisingly good food for a restaurant that looks like a Maggiano's on steroids. Great place to come if Eataly is too crowded, but not a destination in and of itself. "
Basta Pasta,7,7,8,8,parmesean pasta,,Basta pasta definetely wins the unique award for italian cuisine. Cool japanese aesthetic with italian food. Very cool
Blue Hill,10,10,10,10,tasting menu,,The Obama's were on to something. Blue Hill is absolutely great for a nice dinner with your significant other or group. They are old school sustainability with creativity. It’s a particularly fantastic option for vegetarians.
Blue Hill at Stone Barns,7,7,7,7,,,"While we didn't have the best experience here, it’s a great setting and the food is good. It’s a great one time experience"
Bohemian,8,7,8,8,,,"Definitely the cool kid on the block. Complete with secret phone number, this spot is actually surprisingly friendly to those who get a reservation. The cocktails are unique and outstanding. Highly recommended. Very intimate space"
BONDST,8,8,8,8,,,"Bond Street Sushi is fantastic. Very fresh, great service and great scene. They are also very vegetarian friendly. Cool spot"
Boqueria - SoHo,8,8,8,8,"tortilla, churros, pan con tomate, patatas bravas",,"Fun, cool, casual tapas spot. Highly recommended."
Buddakan,6,7,6,6,,,"Big, flashy, mega restaurant. Food is actually pretty good, but like a giant PF Chang's for me"
Cafe Boulud,8,8,8,8,,,"Good, fancy (but not too fancy) french.  'nuff said"
Ciano,9,9,9,9,,,"New go to date/double date spot. Food is great, pastas are wonderful. Ambience is great with the hearth in the middle of the room. Great wine list and an even better wine program that allows you to split bottles with other diners in the restaurant. Ask for a table by the fireplace."
Craft,5,5,5,5,,,"Wickedly over-rated. Good concept, but dated in execution."
Craftbar,3,3,3,3,,,Food mediocre. Resting on laurels. Only good thing about this place is the bar
Daniel,9,9,9,9,tasting menu,,My go to choice for a very fancy meal. The food and service are flawless. This is a particularly great if one or more of your group is vegetarian as they really look after them well (and have a veggie tasting menu). 
Dean's - Tribeca,8,8,6,6,pizza,,"I was skeptical, but the pizza here is just outstanding. Tied with Keste as my favorite pizza place in NY. The sauce is what really sets this place apart."
Do Hwa,8,8,7,7,,,Great downtown Korean. Outstanding flavor in the food here. Nice ambiance as well.
Dos Toros Taqueria,4,4,4,4,,,"I have no idea why people love this place. It is medicore. I would much rather go to Chipotle and probably rather go to Taco bell. I guess the hot salsa is hot which is a plus. Also for vegetarians, their rice has chicken stock"
Dovetail,8,8,8,8,,,Really good UWS restaurant. Meatless Monday's (their not exclusively vegetarian program) is a fun and different choice. Great for date night.
Emporio,8,8,9,7,,,"Fun, cute, romantic spot. Food is great, as is the wine list. Service spotty, but all is forgiven when you eat the pasta. "
Falai,1,4,4,1,,,The service here is the absolute worst. Food is just standard. We needed to wait 90 minutes for our reservation. Someone stole my scarf. The manager is clueless and an ass. Never go here
Frank,7,8,7,7,"fennel salad, burrata",,"Great, simple food. In the summer, there are a few tables outside that are a lot of fun. Place is amazingly popular, so be prepared to wait and get hurried out of your table. They also have takeout/delivery which is great."
Gennaro,8,9,6,8,"kale salad, rigatoni melanze",,"Don't let looks deceive you at this excellent italian restaurant on the UWS. The food is really excellent and the menu is simple. It's cash only so hit the ATM. Bonus: if you are splitting dishes, they will do it for you in the kitchen"
Gobo,8,8,7,7,"sizzling soy cutlet platter, lettuce wraps, ginger sliced seitan",,"A vegetarian place carnivores will like. It’s a great place for a double date, or date night for those that are vegetarian or veggie friendly. Filling, flavorful and delicious. They have a great, speedy and cheaper take out service (lunch also). "
Gramercy Tavern,9,7,8,10,vegetable tasting menu,,"Great for a fancy occasion. Food is great, and the service is impeccible. A must"
Grand Sichuan - Times Square,6,6,4,4,ma po tofu,,"Sichuan food is wonderful, and this is a great choice if Szechuan Gourmet is closed. Otherwise go to Szechuan gourmet"
HanGawi,6,5,7,6,,,"This is a good, upscale vegetarian. I personally think the reputation is actually better than the food. A good go to if you have veggie friends in town"
Hecho en Dumbo,7,8,7,5,,,"I love mexican food. I hate waits. The main problem with Hecho en Dumbo is the absurd waits on the weekends and the unrealistic estimate the host gives (they don't take reservations). The bar area turns into an absolute zoo. That being said, the food is great, and they did bring out a Flan for free to compensate for the wait. The scene is fun & loud. The micheladas and margaritas are awesome as well. If you want the food without the hassle, check out their awesome weekend brunch"
Hundred Acres,6,6,9,7,,,Hipster scene. Beautiful room. Forgettable food.
Jaiya,7,8,5,7,"tofu basil, penang curry, glass noodle salad",,"While not as good as it was, nor as good as the 3 star reviewed JAIYA in Queens, it is the place to go for great, quick thai. There are now many competitors in the area, but it can't be beat for extraordinarily spicy, flavorful thai food. Also, very vegetarian friendly, unlike many Thai joints. A word to the wise,  select medium, not hot. Hot will burn your face off. "
Jean Georges,5,6,5,6,,,There are many better fancy dining options in NY. The best part was the price/value. The food is generally forgetable. Go to Daniel/Per Se or anything else.
Kajitsu,10,10,8,10,the long tasting menu,,"I knew we were on to something when my wife and I went to a talk by David Chang (of Momofuku fame and vegetarian hater) and he declared the all vegetarian Kajitsu his favorite restaurant in NYC. Kajitsu serves Shojin Ryori cuisine, which is a unique, vegetarian cuisine from Japan. I really can't say enough about the restaurant. The dishes are unique and delicious. It is one of the few places I have been to that makes you think about each and every dish. It is super unique place in NY. A highly recommended destination for Carnivores and Vegetarians alike. As a tip, if it is just 2 of you, request a seat at the bar. "
Keste,8,9,7,7,"pizza margherita, truffle bread",,We met some Italians waiting in line for a table at Keste. They said it was the best Pizza they have had outside of Italy. I agree. 
Kittichai,6,7,7,6,,,"So Kittichai is a good solid choice for those looking for a hip restaurant feel, but it feels a bit past its prime. Nothing particularly good or bad here in my opinion. Great place for out of towners. Much better than Lotus of Sian"
La Esquina,7,8,5,5,tacos,,"La Esquina is a good, solid place for a quick taco. I think they have some serious competition from Fonda Nolita on Elizabeth street. Good place for people watching and fresh tacos"
Locanda Verde,8,8,8,8,"pastas, appetizers",,"I really like this place (if you can get a rez. In addition to an awesome dinner/wine list, they have a great brunch and it’s a great downtown weekday breakfast option. Highly recommended for Dinner with friends/family or date night"
Lotus of Siam,3,2,4,1,,,The worst Thai restaurant in NYC. I would rather go to Spice. 
Maialino,8,8,8,8,"eggs cacio pepe, spaghetti cacio pepe",,"I think this place is fantastic- a great place for breakfast or lunch. The food is great, the ambience is the perfect level of formal/casual, the wine list is fantastic. It is great for breakfast/brunch and dinner. For those that can get in, the rose bar is a great place for a drink across the hall. Also, for those that don't plan in advance, they have a no reservation area toward the front of the restaurant"
Marc Forgione,6,6,8,7,,,"I don't know what all the fuss is about. People seem to love it, but it was just OK when we went. I don’t even remember it"
Marea,9,9,8,8,pastas,,"Seafood is what Marea is known for, but the broader selection is excellent as well. The food is really inventive and delicious. A great place for people watching (we sat next to Madonna). Great, high end night out"
Mercadito,8,8,6,6,"mushroom tostada, guacamole sampler",,The restaurant is tiny. The food is delicious and noise level is deafening. The margaritas and micheladas are really great as well. The restaurant takes (and sometimes honors) reservations. Very casual place. Filled with hipsters and yuppies.
Mexicana Mama - East Village,8,8,7,7,"burritos, bean soup, salsa sampler, enchiladas, corn on the cob",,"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in NYC. The quirky owner Patty infuses the place with charm. The Jalepeno margaritas are an absolute must. They have a number of seasonal specials. My favorite is the cold black bean soup. The salsa sampler is absolutely awesome. They don't take reservations, but the wait usually isn't so bad. Their take on mexican cuisine is usually a bit different than most (e.g. their Mole Enchilada's aren't drenched in sauce but have a dollop of delicious Mole). I love it!"
Mole - West Village,6,6,6,6,,,"Good, solid mexican. Nothing special, nothing terrible. "
Momofuku Milk Bar,9,9,5,6,"cereal milk (soft serve/milk), crack pie, cornflake cookie",,An awesome place for a quick sugar fix. The dessert there is very casual (soft serve/milk's/cookies/pies) and there are communal tables to share if you don't want to walk around outside or take it home. The desserts there are familiar and inventive at the same time. 
Nobu Fifty Seven,8,8,8,8,"tomato ceviche, spicy garlic donbury",heart of palm salad,"Nobu is awesome. I think it is the single best lunch spot in NY (also good for dinner). The value you get for lunch is absolutely insane with Soup, Salad and Entrée for between 15-35 dollars. The service is great and always spot on. A quick tip, tell the server if you are vegetarian and they will prepare dishes without fish. The tasting menu is also excellent. Also, somewhat surprisingly its a great place for a vegetarian meal as they have tons and tons of options. "
Norma's,6,6,6,6,"oatmeal brulee, omelettes",,"Overpriced, tourist trap. Skip it, better places to go in NYC."
Nougatine,8,8,8,8,,,"Great, casual alternative to Jean Georges. Food is solid, service great, prices much lower than Jean Georges (which shares the same space). Really good for brunch as well. Good go to in midtown."
Osteria Morini,2,4,4,4,,,"I know others love it, but I think this place sucks. I have been there 3 times (mainly because everyone else seems to rave about it). The place is cramped and looks pretty crappy, the service is generally inflexible and spotty and the food is very heavy and not nearly as good as Michael White's other restaurants (see my review of Marea). Ditch, ditch, ditch"
Otto,8,8,8,8,"olive oil gelato, any pizza",,"The place is fantastic and always delivers. Service great, wine list is absolutely awesome and the food can't be beat for a high end pizza. The Gelato's are a must, get a sampling of 3 to try some of the creative flavors. Also, if you go early, it is very kid friendly"
Per Se,9,9,9,9,tasting menu,,"For this price it better deliver, and it does. I have been 3 times now and it is very good. For my money, I would probably prefer another high end establishment (Like Daniel) or something a bit more intimate (Blue Hill). Most of the reason is that it is so damn expensive! $250 tasting menu (including tip), $90 wine corkage etc. The food is the best in the city, but is it worth such a price? I don't know."
Public,8,8,8,7,"bloody maria's, turkish eggs, granola, lentil salad",,"This place is great- Food is good, service good. Great cocktails. I personally think this is also the best brunch in NY. Served in an awesome, chic loftlike space, the cavernous restaurant is wonderful. For those who need a private dining space, they organize a great private room. If you are meeting people for drinks, there is a back room that is quiet and awesome as well"
Pulino's Bar and Pizzeria,2,2,2,2,,,"Why go here, it sucks. Only they could have taken the best location downtown and screwed it up with a mediocre pizza place. There are a ton of other options. I would rather go to whole foods (across the street)."
Pure Food and Wine,8,7,9,6,raw everything,,"You need to be in the mood for something different. But, to the extent you are in the mood "
Tacombi @ Fonda Nolita,9,9,9,8,"bean tacos, breakfast tacos, corn tacos",,"This is the best taqueria in NYC. Bar none. The food is fresh, healthy and just delicious. I Love, love, love the tacos. @ 4 bucks a pop, it’s a pretty good deal. It’s about a 12 dollar meal. The breakfast tacos are also just fantastic. The staff is great. If I could pick a single place to eat 3 meals a day at, it would be Tacombi"
