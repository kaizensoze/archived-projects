A Voce Columbus,8,8,10,6,,,"Food was all excellent.  Views of central park are gorgeous - ask for a table near the windows.  Service is weird and unprofessional, with busboys asking us if we were indian (I didn't think I was in a taxi???) and stumbling to describe the food as they delivered it.  Host was similarly awkward.  "
A Voce Madison,8,8,8,8,,,Food as good as uptown restaurant.  Views not as nice.  Service better.  
ABC Kitchen,9,9,9,9,,,Food is interesting and good.  Space is beautiful and well decorated.  Light and airy.  Love the ambience.  
Aldea,8,8,7,8,,,Mezzanine is dark and has low ceilings.  Weird and cramped for a michelin starred restaurant.  Food unhealthy but delicious. 
Aureole,7,7,6,7,,,"Food is reliable, if a bit predictable and uninteresting.  Service can be spotty (once had iced tea spilled on me twice in the same meal).  Ambience is atrocious, very stuffy and corporate. "
Babbo,10,10,10,10,"mint love letters, chianti stained pappardelle with wild boar ragu",,"Very quaint ambience (brownstone), excellent service, delicious food.  If only it were easier to get a table… Go at 6pm and snag a table in the bar area w/o a reservation, or eat at the bar itself.  "
Bar Breton,6,6,6,7,nutella galette,,"Was introduced to this restaurant by a friend with a gluten allergy… it is certified gluten free.  Food was unexpectedly good, ambience ok, service totally acceptable.  Wine list is poor and overpriced."
BLT Fish,7,7,7,7,,,Reliable and well-executed seafood.  Nothing particularly memorable or creative.  
BLT Prime,7,8,7,7,tuna tartare,,I like this place b/c the non-steak mains are actually good.  This is a rare find in a steakhouse. 
Bohemian,8,8,8,8,"sashimi, sliders",,"Love everything about this place, from the vibe inside which makes you feel like you are in a friend's living room, to the japanese butcher out front which serves as a mask for the discreet restaurant in the back.  "
BONDST,7,7,8,7,,,"Been pregnant for like 7 yrs straight, so I'll pass on reviewing this one. "
Chola,6,7,6,6,all std punjabi main dishes,,"Solid, reliable Punjabi food in a crowded / loud / casual setting.  Service is not great.  "
Ciano,7,7,7,7,roasted veal meatballs,,"Good italian food.  Interesting, well-executed pastas.  Only complaint is the limited selection (menu is quite short).  Maybe it's a little expensive for what it is.  "
Craft,6,5,7,7,,,"I always enjoy the quality of ingredients and cooking at a Tom C restaurant, but I don't love the concept of this place.  DIY approach to plate construction (you have to pair your own proteins / sides) works at a cheesy midwestern chain like Big Bowl.  But when I'm paying $100+ / person for food, I sort of don't expect to do much work, moreover, I expect something a little unexpected and more original than ""Chicken"" from the ""Meat - Roasted"" section and ""Bok Choy"" from the ""Vegetables - Sauteed"" section.  Really??  In addition to seeming lazy as a concept, it also feels a bit commercial - this way they get to charge you twice for the same course.  I'm sorry, this is only allowed at steakhouses!!!  Want food which is 95% as good for less than 50% of the cost?  Walk west to Tom C's Craftbar!!! "
Craftbar,9,9,9,9,fennel salad,,"Excellent value for money.  High-end food for medium prices.  Produce is fresh, preparations are well executed if sometimes lacking creativity.  Fish and pasta dishes shine more than starters.  Setting is bustling but not loud, service is friendly but not overbearing or pushy.  While it is not a classic ""family-friendly"" place, they have been very accomodative when we do go with children.  "
Crema,7,7,7,7,"chicken mole burrito, tuna burrito",,"Nice high-end mexican.  Good alternative to the chains (rosa, dos caminos).  Not as good as Maya or Pampano!  "
Eleven Madison Park,10,9,10,10,,,"Excellent preparations and impeccable service.  We go only 2-3x / year yet they greet us by name when we walk in.  Not a huge fan of the new menu format, preferred the old menu.  "
Gobo,6,7,6,6,braised bean curd,,Solid veg food.  Everything tastes light and healthy.  Juices are delicious. 
Gotham Bar and Grill,7,8,6,7,,,"Tables for 2 can feel cramped, they are packed in right next to each other.  Have not been disappointed with the food here.  Service is so-so.  Unlike most restaurants with michelin stars and these prices, you can be in and out in under 2 hours with no problems if you specify in advance.  "
Grimaldi's - Chelsea,7,10,5,5,pizza,,
Keste,8,10,6,7,butternut squash pizza,,Best neapolitan-style pizza in manhattan.  Butternut squash pizza is unique and delicious.  Tomato sauce is so fresh.  Be prepared to wait for a table.  
Kittichai,7,7,8,6,"braised short ribs, scallops, hangar steak",,"Good high-end thai food.  I prefer the more unique dishes - briased short ribs, scallops, hangar steak - the ingredients which are difficult to find at the typical ny down-market thai restaurants.  Staples such as mango salad and pad thai are good also.  Decor is nice.  They also offer a brunch special on weekends which is a pretty good deal.  "
Les Halles,8,8,7,8,"Steak salad, French onion soup",,"Classic French Bistro fare, well-executed in a casual and fun setting.  Waitstaff was really helpful and accomodating of our kids"
Lure Fishbar,7,7,6,7,"lobster roll, burger, crab cakes",,"Great seafood spot in soho.  Décor is a bit tacky (designed to look like the inside of an *ugly but expensive* ship).  Recently attended an event they catered, highly recommend, the food did not suffer at all for being served outside the restaurant. "
Maya,9,9,8,9,"mole poblano, mahi mahi, camarones al chipotle, tampiquena",,Richard Sandoval is the best mexican food chef in NYC.  Inconvenient location but food is worth the travel. 
Mercadito,7,8,6,6,"guacamoles, all tacos, all ceviches",,Richard Sandoval's brother *might* just be the 2nd best mexican food chef in NYC!!! 
Naya,6,7,6,6,chicken shish taouk,,Ever live in London?  Miss lebanese food?  Finally available in NYC!  This place is solid.  It's no Noura's but it's cheaper than buying a plane ticket.  
Otto,6,6,6,6,,,"Excellent Excellent Excellent wine list.  Best wine list in the city for a restaurant with these price points.  You can enjoy a $300 bottle of barolo or brunello di montalcino with your $10 pizza, Sideways-style!  Food is ok.  Pizza is roman style thin crust, not my favorite.  Pastas are uninspired but well executed for the most part.  Vegetable starters and salads are my favorite part of this meal.  "
Pampano,8,8,8,8,"ceviche tasting, all seafood mains",,"New mexican - a more conveniently located, slightly less tasty version of Maya with more emphasis on seafood on the menu.  Great roofdeck for summertime al fresco dining.  "
Perry Street,8,8,8,8,"crispy calamari, truffle crusted cod",,"Have only been for weekend brunch - which is a steal at $26 for 3 courses.  The crispy calamari is very good, with a unique batter and sauce combo - very different.  Truffle crusted cod is very good.  Ambience / décor is somewhat corporate, but the location right across the street from the water is nice.  "
Picholine,5,5,5,5,,,"Service was weird.  We went on a Saturday night, place was only 2/3 full, yet we were given a pretty crappy table.  We sat through the waiter telling us about specials before asking for new seats, only to have him not realize it and read us the whole specials list at our NEW table - WEIRD!  Food was really unimaginative and not very good.  Can't even remember anything I ate - so it wasn't so bad it left an impression, but with the ratings this place has I was very disappointed in the whole experience."
Pipa,7,6,8,7,,,"A flatiron staple - good, reliable tapas.  Fun vibe, just the right noise level for a social night out.  Wouldn't take kids.  Love the kitschy décor.  As a person who is not a fan of boqueria, I like the tapas at Pipa.  Love the fact that it is still buzzing a decade after opening. "
Raoul's,9,9,9,8,"Octopus with chickpeas, any of the seafood main courses, steak au poivre, quinoa vinaigrette",,Great french bistro fare - great for people watching - bit crowded but that's part of the vibe.  
Rosa Mexicano - Flatiron,7,6,7,7,,,"Food was much better 5 years ago.  Still solid and reliable for the staples - steak tacos, guacamole, etc.  But seafood is not as fresh as it used to be.  Good private rooms for hosting events - excellent service for private events.  "
Saravanaas,6,7,6,5,"mini tiffin platter, dosas, idli",,"Good solid south Indian food - wear machine washable clothing to this restaurant, you will come out smelling like the food! "
Shake Shack - Madison Square Park,6,8,5,5,,,"Danny Meyer + burgers for under $5, what more is there to say?"
Stanton Social,8,8,9,7,"pierogies, french onion soup dumplings, spinach salad, red snapper tacos, chipotle grilled shrimp, all the different sliders. ",,"Fancy comfort food with a trendy downtown vibe.  Great cocktails, great food, great décor, pretty good ppl watching to boot.  "
Tamarind,7,7,8,7,,,"Another flatiron staple (see Pipa review) - serving up high end indian food reliably and consistently for over a decade.  Not as imaginative as some of our favorite indian spots in London, but gets the job done if what you seek is indian fare with a little less grease and a little more class.  Check out the tearoom next door for delicious sandwiches (and tea!) on a saturday afternoon. "
The Standard Grill,7,7,8,7,,,Surprisingly good food for a trendy restaurant!  Walk-in early and snag a table in the bar area at this tough-to-get-a-reservation MPD hotspot.
