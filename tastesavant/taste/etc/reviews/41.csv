21 Club,5,6,5,7,filet,,An old classic that hasn't moved forward with the times. Good for a work lunch if you're in midtown or pre-theatre but too many new / good restaurants to return for this old classic.
ABC Kitchen,9,9,10,7,"goat cheese pizza, housemade sodas",,"John G gets it right. Perfect for a family dinner / date spot / catch-up with the boys. Great ambience and all the dishes are great. If you can't get a res; eat at the bar, its worth it. "
Babbo,9,10,7,9,,,Fantastic food and service. Very knowledgeable staff. Eating at the bar on a weekday is a perfect evening.
Bar Pitti,7,8,6,5,pesto pasta,,"Good value. Great scene. Perfect for a nice summer night. I can't deal with the brunch wait but if you can, bring your aviators so you look the part. "
Cafe Habana,8,10,6,5,corn on the cob,,"Casual downtown dining with a bit of cuban flavor. This is for the locals, but the corn is the best in the city. "
Del Posto,7,7,10,10,tasting menu,,"Beautiful venue / fantastic service but you are paying full price here. A special occasion place when you feel like being fancy and dressing up. Tasting menu is great, including for vegetarians. "
Joseph Leonard,10,10,10,10,,,Best spot in the village hands down. Great food / friendly staff / great ambience. Perfect for any night of the week. 
Kittichai,4,4,7,5,,,Expensive thai that doesn't taste good. 
Locanda Verde,4,4,8,5,,,Ok for brunch I hear but was VERY underwhelmed with the food. I'm never going back. 
Lupa,7,6,6,6,,,Not my favorite Batali. Somewhere between Babbo and Otto. Stick with the other two in my view. 
Macao Trading Co.,6,6,8,6,,,"Good atmosphere, especially downstairs for a date but I'd stick with Mr. Chow if you crave Chinese and are in Tribeca."
Maialino,8,7,7,9,sea bass for 2,,"Great gramercy park find; not so traditional Italian but a helpful wait staff makes this an enjoyable experience. Less good for vegetarians; not surprising given the name: ""Little Pig""."
Malatesta,9,9,7,7,pasta,,Excellent neighborhood restaurant that I would recommend you make the trip down to from anywhere in the city. Great atmosphere / value for any night of the week. Would skip the outdoor tables in the summer; too close to West Side Highway / Path Train pedestrian traffic.
Mama Mexico ,7,8,6,6,green enchiladas,,"If you can stand the band, a staple mid-town mexican destination. I'd skip the gauc but you get your Mexican fix here. Don't make plans for after though;  you will need a nap."
Marea,9,9,9,9,scallops,,Excellent food. Highly recommend for lunch / dinner. Great service. Top pick in midtown.
Mercadito,8,9,7,6,,,"If you are are in the mood for tacos, this is a great place. I prefer the west village spot here. "
Mexicana Mama - East Village,9,10,6,4,mole chicken,,"Good Mexican food hard to come by in NYC but this place has staying power. Best mole sauce in the city and you have to order the salsa sampler. Be careful, habanero sauce is spicy!"
Minetta Tavern,9,9,8,6,burger,,I'm not cool enough to get a res but a friend did and it was worth it. Total scene but the burger is worth it. 
Morandi,7,6,6,6,,,Over-rated but I still go back because it’s a good atmosphere and location. Food is fine. 
Morimoto,7,6,8,8,rock shrimp,,Best rock shrimp in the city. Mediocre sushi. More of a B&T crowd. Would stick with Nobu though would a visit once in awhile. Good service.
Otto,6,6,5,4,,,Cheap italian for decent size groups.
Patroon,7,9,5,6,burger,,Power lunch. Enough Said.
Quality Meats,8,8,9,7,filet,,Great midtown steakhouse and ambience if you don't want your porterhouse to share. Great martinis.
Rosa Mexicano - Flatiron,7,7,7,5,guacamole,,"Best gauc in the city. Good margaritas. Pretty much you get what you pay for here, but it’s a staple."
Shake Shack - Madison Square Park,9,10,5,5,,,"NY Classic -- perfect for your burger and fries fix. If you go, don't count calories and have a milkshake!"
Sparks,7,7,6,7,,,"Classic NYC steakhouse. Unless you are a banker on a closing dinner, try something else."
Spice Market,5,4,7,5,,,Leave it for the B&T crowd.
Spotted Pig,7,6,6,5,burger,,Classic west village spot. I would go for the beer unless you want a late night burger fix. Stick to the weekdays though. 
Tamarind,9,9,10,7,"saag paneer, tandoori chicken",,"Best Indian food in the city. Atmosphere is great and food is high quality -- but with Indian food that's not always what you want. This is Michelin star meets Mumbai. If you want greasy, stick with Curry Hill."
The Fat Radish,7,6,9,5,,,Great ambience / great scene / decent food. Long commute unless you live on the east side / downtown. 
Wolfgangs,9,10,7,6,,,"Best ""steak for x"" in the city. Why go to Lugers when you can stay here?"
Yerba Buena - Perry,6,5,7,5,,,Cool little place in the west village but food is mediocre and my sense is it won't have staying power.
