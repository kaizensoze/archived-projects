            <li>You shall and hereby do release us from all liability for you having acquired or not acquired housing through the Services, except where such release is prohibited or limited by New York law or public policy.</li>
            <li>You hereby release us and our Members, employees, agents, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, predecessors, assigns, heirs, service providers, insurers, investors, attorneys, advisors, and suppliers, from all claims, demands and damages of every kind and nature, known and unknown, direct and indirect, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to content accessed through the Online Services or our services, or any interactions with others arising out of or related thereto, and you expressly waive the provisions of any local law, which provides in substance: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor," and all similar code provisions in any jurisdiction.</li>
          </ol>
          <h2>P. ARBITRATION</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>YOU AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US (WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DISPUTE INVOLVES A THIRD PARTY) WITH REGARD TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH US, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DISPUTES RELATED TO THESE TERMS OF USE, YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, AND/OR RIGHTS OF PRIVACY AND/OR PUBLICITY, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION UNDER THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION'S RULES FOR ARBITRATION OF CONSUMER-RELATED DISPUTES AND YOU AND WE HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY. DISCOVERY AND RIGHTS TO APPEAL IN ARBITRATION ARE GENERALLY MORE LIMITED THAN IN A LAWSUIT, AND OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU AND WE WOULD HAVE IN COURT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.  If available as an alternative, you may bring a claim in "small claims" court in Kings County, New York, or small claims court in the County of a Nooklyn office, if you would otherwise be permitted to do so by that small claims court's rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf.</li>
          </ol>
          <h2>Q. WAIVER OF CLASS ACTION PARTICIPTION</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER ON ANY CLASS CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST US INCLUDING ANY RIGHT TO CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY CONSOLIDATION OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if we are a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and not by any state law concerning arbitration. In the event the American Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either we or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use.  This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with us.</li>
          </ol>
          <h2>R. MISCELLANEOUS</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>These Terms of Use, together with any other agreements and mandatory disclosure forms (Landlord and Tenant;   Buyers and Sellers) provided by us to you separately and incorporated herein by this sentence, are the entire agreement between you and us with respect to the Services, including use of the Site, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between you and us with respect to the Services. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms of Use will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder</li>
            <li>Force Majeure.  For any remaining obligation not already disclaimed above, we shall not be liable for any failure to perform any such obligation where such failure results from any cause beyond our reasonable control, including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation, or third party acts or omission</li>
            <li>These Terms of Use are personal to you, and are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with our prior written consent. We may assign, transfer or delegate any of our rights and obligations hereunder without consent.</li>
            <li>No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created as a result of these Terms of Use and neither party has any authority of any kind to bind the other in any respect.</li>
            <li>Unless otherwise specified in these Term of Service, all notices under these Terms of Use will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered or sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; when receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or e-mail; or the day after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized overnight delivery service. Electronic notices should be sent to help@nooklyn.com.</li>
            <li>These Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, including its conflicts of law rules.

OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.</li>
            <li>Our failure to enforce any part of these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of our right to later enforce that or any other part of these Terms of Use. Waiver of compliance in any particular instance does not mean that we will waive compliance in the future. In order for any waiver of compliance with these Terms of Use to be binding, we must provide you with written notice of such waiver through one of our authorized representatives.</li>
            <li>Any section and paragraph headings in these Terms of Use are for convenience only and shall not affect their interpretation.</li>
            <li>These Terms of Use are for the benefit of us and our affiliates, vendors, and suppliers, and our and their officers, directors, employees, affiliates, agents, licensors, and suppliers. Each of these entities and individuals shall have the right to assert and enforce these Terms of Use directly against you on its or their behalf.</li>
            <li>No ambiguity of any term or provision in this Agreement shall be construed adversely to Nooklyn as drafter of this Agreement.</li>
